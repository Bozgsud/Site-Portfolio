    	<h1 class="Aboutmetext"> I am an eighth grade student at the NSPhM school, filled with dreams and ambitions for my future. I was born on September 10, 2010 (I'm currently 13) in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Throughout my life, I have tried many sports and at the same time tried to be an excellent student. I managed to try out many sports and was good at some: first taekwondo, then swimming, then football, then tennis, and now I’m playing table tennis. I showed the best results in taekwondo and table tennis. Also, from early childhood, my grandmother taught me to participate and win in all kinds of Olympiads and competitions. </h1>

To move, use "w", "a", "s", "d", to interact with something - "q", <br> and to attack - "e".
